=head1 Turbo Vision

Turbo Vision is a character-mode text user interface framework.

Turbo Vision C++ is a framework developed by Borland. It is a text-based user 
interface framework created in the early 1990s by Borland.

Turbo Vision was integrated into Borland Pascal, Turbo Pascal, and Borland C++ 
and was used to create integrated development environments (IDEs) for these 
programming languages.

The framework offers various user interface elements such as edit fields, 
list boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and menus, all of which have mouse 
support.

=head2 History

Turbo Vision was originally written in Pascal and C++ and was intended for 
MS-DOS and IBM PC compatible systems.

It was later discontinued in favor of the Object Windows Library, the Win16 API,
and the GUI tools of Borland Delphi. In 1997, Borland released the C++ source 
code into the public domain.

Although Turbo Vision was later released into the public domain and further 
developed by an open-source community, there are no known ports to Perl.

Most further developments and ports focused on other platforms, such as Unix 
systems.

=head2 Perl TVision

Starting in 2025, I made the previously private project public after 
successfully porting the Turbo Vision C++ framework to Perl for the target 
platform Windows 10 and 11 (after two failed attempts, see commits history for 
details). 

This port is based on the original codebase of Borland C++ 4.02
(Turbo Vision 2.0 sources including bug fixes by Eric Woodruff: 
L<tv2fixed.zip|http://www.sigala.it/sergio/tvision/source/tv2fixed.zip>).

Perl TVision allows developers to use the powerful text-based user interfaces of
Turbo Vision in Perl, significantly simplifying the development of applications 
on console based systems.

=head3 Key Features of the Port

=over

=item B<Compatibility>

The port supports 32-bit and 64-bit Strawberry Perl versions >= 5.10 and covers 
a wide range of Windows systems (Please note that not all combinations of 
Windows versions and Perl versions could be checked by me).

=item B<User Interfaces>

All original user interface elements such as edit fields, list boxes, 
checkboxes, radio buttons, and menus are available in Perl and offer full mouse 
support (in the future, so please don't be angry that this is more of an 
announcement, as so far only the basics are working).

=item B<Extensibility>

A I<Moo/s/e> based toolkit was used to ensure that the applications remain 
efficient and portable. The toolkit enables developers to extend the 
functionality of Perl TVision easily and efficiently. The L<Moos> package (by 
default), L<Moo> and L<Moose> are currently supported. 

L<Moo> and L<Moose> are widely used libraries with a well-known API. It is 
important to note that L<Moo> and L<Moose> are not required as prerequisites! 
The default toolkit L<Moos> is compatible with this API and implemented in pure 
Perl. 

It's up to you what you want to use. Simply C<use Moo> in your application, 
instead of C<use TV::toolkit> if you want to use L<Moo>. Perl TVision will then 
use L<Moo> in its entirety (the same applies to L<Moose>, of course). 

=back

=head3 Installation and Usage

The port can be installed via CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). Simply
run the following command:

   cpan install TurboVision

A simple example to create an application with Turbo Vision in Perl:

   use TV::App;

   my $app = TApplication->new();
   $app->run();

=head3 Documentation and Support

Detailed documentation and examples can be found in the CPAN or GitHub 
repository of this port.

Please note that this is a very recent version of the port of the 
Turbo Vision C++ framework to Perl. Although I have done my best to create a 
stable and functional version, there may still be bugs and instabilities.

However, I do my best to answer questions and bug fixes quickly and reliably. 
Your feedback is extremely valuable to continuously improve the quality and 
stability of this port. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any 
problems or questions. For this use the GitHub issue tracker and the Github 
discussion channel.

I hope this port will facilitate the development of text-based applications in 
Perl on Windows systems and look forward to feedback and contributions from the 
developer community.
